# PowerBi-Dashboards

## Project Overview

This repository contains two comprehensive data analysis projects using PowerBI and BigQuery SQL. The first project analyzes a dataset of 50,000 songs between 2000 and 2020, and the second project analyzes a dataset of professional wrestling championships (WWE/WWF). Both projects demonstrate my skills in using PowerBI and BigQuery SQL to uncover insights and communicate findings effectively.

## Projects

### 1. Songs Dataset (2000-2020, 50k Records)

**Dataset:**
- Source: Kaggle.com
- Link: [Songs Dataset (2000-2020, 50k Records)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/songs-dataset-2000-2020-50k-records)

**Purpose:**
The goal of this project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset of 50,000 songs released between 2000 and 2020. The analysis demonstrates my ability to use PowerBI and BigQuery SQL to extract unique insights and relationships from the data.

**Steps:**
1. **Data Exploration using SQL:**
   - The dataset was first explored using BigQuery SQL to identify unique insights and relationships among the column headers.

2. **Visualization using PowerBI:**
   - The dataset was then imported into PowerBI for further analysis and visualization.
   - Key insights and trends were visualized to effectively communicate findings to a variety of audience members.
   - Example visualizations include the distribution of song genres, the top artists by the number of songs, and the trend of song popularity over the years.

### 2. Professional Wrestling Championships (WWE/WWF)

**Dataset:**
- Source: Kaggle.com
- Link: [Professional Wrestling Championships (WWE/WWF)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daverasmussen/professional-wrestling-champions)

**Purpose:**
The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset of professional wrestling championships (WWE/WWF) to demonstrate my skills in using PowerBI and BigQuery SQL to uncover unique insights and trends.

**Steps:**
1. **Data Exploration using SQL:**
   - The dataset was initially explored using BigQuery SQL to identify unique insights and relationships among the column headers.

2. **Visualization using PowerBI:**
   - The dataset was then imported into PowerBI for further analysis and visualization.
   - Key insights and trends were visualized to effectively communicate findings to a variety of audience members.
   - Example visualizations include the distribution of championship titles, the top wrestlers by the number of titles won, and the trend of titles awarded over the years.
