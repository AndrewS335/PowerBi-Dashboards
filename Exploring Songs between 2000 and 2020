This a project analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 50,000 songs between 2000 and 2020. The dataset was analyzed by using BigQuery SQL using a dataset provided by Kaggle.com, for the exact dataset please use this provided link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/songs-dataset-2000-2020-50k-records. The specific dataset is called, â€œSongs Dataset (2000-2020, 50k Records). 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills using PowerBI and BigQuery SQL, as well as my ability to communicate insights and findings using a popular business intelligence tool and database language to a variety of audience members. 

The dataset was first explored by using SQL to find unique insights and relationships among the column headers in the CSV file. Below is the SQL scripts used to develop each insight. 

1.	Show the entire dataset.

SELECT 	
	*
FROM
	songs_2000_2020_50k

2.	Count all the songs in the dataset. 

SELECT 
	COUNT(*)
FROM	
	songs_2000_2020_50k

3.	Check the dataset for null values in each column.

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN title IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_title_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN artist IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_artist_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN album IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_album_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN genre IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_genre_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN release_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_release_date_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN duration IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_duration_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN popularity IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_popularity_count
FROM
    songs_2000_2020_50k;

4.	Count the number of songs made by each artist.

SELECT 
    artist,
    COUNT(album) AS album_counT
FROM
    songs_2000_2020_50k
GROUP BY
    artist
Order by 
	album_count DESC

5.	Count the number of songs made each year. 

SELECT 
    SUBSTRING(release_date FROM 1 FOR 4) AS release_year,
    COUNT(title) AS title_count
FROM 
    songs_2000_2020_50k
GROUP BY 
    SUBSTRING(release_date FROM 1 FOR 4)
ORDER BY 
    release_year ASC;

6.	Count the total duration of songs made each year per genre.

SELECT 
    SUBSTRING(release_date FROM 1 FOR 4) AS release_year,
    genre, 
    COUNT(duration) AS duration_total
FROM
    songs_2000_2020_50k
GROUP BY 
    SUBSTRING(release_date FROM 1 FOR 4),
    genre
ORDER BY 
    release_year DESC;
