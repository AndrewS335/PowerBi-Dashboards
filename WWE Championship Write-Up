This is a project analyzing a comprehensive dataset of professional wrestling championships. The dataset was analyzed by using BigQuery SQL using a dataset provided by Kaggle.com, for the exact dataset please use this provided link  < Professional Wrestling Champions (WWE/WWF) (kaggle.com)>. The specific dataset is called, â€œProfessional Wrestling Championships (WWE/WWF).  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills using PowerBI and BigQuery SQL, as well as my ability to communicate insights and findings using a popular business intelligence tool and database language to a variety of audience members. 

The dataset was first explored by using SQL to find unique insights and relationships among the column headers in the CSV file. Below is the SQL scripts used to develop each insight. 

1. Count the Total Number of Records in the Dataset:
SELECT 
COUNT(*) AS total_records 
FROM 
wrestling_data;

2. Find the Average Length of Reign (in Days):
SELECT 
AVG(days) AS average_reign_length 
FROM 
wrestling_data;

3. Count the Number of Records with a Specific Belt (e.g., 'WWE Championship'):
SELECT 
COUNT(*) AS total_wwe_championships 
FROM
wrestling_data 
WHERE 
belt = 'WWE Championship';

4. Get the Oldest and Youngest Age at Death:
SELECT 
MIN(DATE_PART('year', age(date_of_death, date_of_birth))) AS youngest_age,
MAX(DATE_PART('year', age(date_of_death, date_of_birth))) AS oldest_age
FROM 
wrestling_data
WHERE 
date_of_death IS NOT NULL;

5. Find the Wrestler with the Longest Reign:
SELECT 
name, 
days 
FROM 
wrestling_data 
ORDER BY 
days DESC 
LIMIT 
1;

6. Count the Number of Wrestlers Who Died from a Specific Cause (e.g., 'Liver cancer'):
SELECT 
COUNT(*) AS total_liver_cancer_deaths 
FROM 
wrestling_data 
WHERE 
cause_of_death = 'Liver cancer';

7. List All Events That Occurred in 'New York, NY':
SELECT 
name, 
event, 
date
FROM 
wrestling_data 
WHERE 
location = 'New York, NY';

8. Get the Average Age of Wrestlers at the Time of Their Reign:
SELECT 
AVG(DATE_PART('year', age(date, date_of_birth))) AS average_age_at_reign 
FROM 
wrestling_data;

9. Find the Total Number of Unique Locations:
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT location) AS unique_locations 
FROM 
wrestling_data;

10. Retrieve the Records of Wrestlers Who Held the Title for More Than 100 Days:
SELECT 
* 
FROM 
wrestling_data 
WHERE 
days > 100;
